# Google-Books-Search

Google-Books-Search is a React-based app that allows users to search the Google Books API.  Once a title is found, the user has the option to "View" the book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Save" the book, saving it to the Mongo database.  On the "Saved" page, the user has the option again to "View" the book on Google Books, or "Delete" the book from the "Saved" page...
